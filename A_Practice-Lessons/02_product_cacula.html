    Cart Products Calculation
  </h2>
   product 1 price = $ 14.60 <br>
   Quantity = 2 <br>
   product 2nd Price = $ 19.90 <br>

   The calculated cost will be : 14.60 * 2 + 19.90 = ? <br>
   All Cost = '' <br>
   Shifing charges = 3.35 <br>
   Now the totol cost of the product wil be: All cost + shipping charges <br>

   <h3> Order Of Operations Like general maths</h3>
    <P> + ADDING -SUBTRACTING *MULTIPLICATION /DIVISIONS ()BRACKETS </P>

    Let's Apply it : <br> 

    Example: We have a bat for : $20.40 and two balls for 4.90 each . Calculate the prrice and also add a tax of 10% withe the total price<br>
     Total cost: 20.40 + 4.90 * 2 * 0.1 = 21.38 which is wrong.
    <br> We can calculate it: (20.40 + 4.90 * 2) * 0.1 = 3.02  <br>  OR  <br>
     So cost will be : 20.40 + 4.90 * 2 = 30.2 <br>
     and wit taxt : <br>
     30.2 * 0.1 = 3.02 <br>


     Note: check the result of adding 0.1 + 0.2= 0.3000000000004 OR <br>
     20.95 + 7.99 = 939999999998 <br>
     to avoid this we should ignore or remove the point for the corect  money e.g, 2095 + 799  then put in the braket add it and divide by 100 e.g, (2095 + 799 )/100 = $28.94

     <h3>Rounding a number in JavaScript</h3>
     Math.round(2.6) and see the result in the console <br>
     ((2099 +799) * 0.1) /100 = 2.894 <br>
     Math.round((2099 +799) * 0.1) / 100 it will nowshow the result in 2.894 due to the answer 2.894
